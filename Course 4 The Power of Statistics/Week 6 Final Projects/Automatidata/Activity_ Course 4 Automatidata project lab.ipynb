    "**Note:** For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 1) customers who are required to pay with credit card, 2) customers who are required to pay with cash. Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n",

    "**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.\n",

    "- **Summarizing Data Distribution:** Descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range) provide information about the distribution of your data. They give you a sense of the typical values, the spread of the data, and the presence of outliers or unusual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Detecting Skewness and Symmetry:** Descriptive statistics, such as skewness and kurtosis, help you understand the shape of your data distribution. Positive or negative skewness indicates a departure from symmetry, while kurtosis measures the degree of peakedness or flatness in the distribution. These statistics can reveal important characteristics about your data and guide further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Central Tendency:** Measures of central tendency, such as the mean or median, provide insight into the typical or representative value of the data. They help you understand the center around which the data points tend to cluster and can be used to make comparisons or assess deviations from the norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assessing Variability and Spread:** Descriptive statistics like variance and standard deviation quantify the spread or variability of your data. They indicate how much the data points deviate from the mean and can help identify patterns, trends, or differences between groups or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understanding Relationships and Correlations:** Descriptive statistics, such as correlation coefficients, can help you explore the relationships between variables. They provide insights into the strength and direction of the linear association between variables, allowing you to identify potential dependencies or patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identifying Outliers:** Descriptive statistics can help identify outliers, which are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data. Outliers can indicate measurement errors, anomalies, or unique observations that require further investigation."

    "\n",
    "- **Revenue Analysis:** By analyzing the fare amounts based on payment types, the company can gain insights into revenue generation. They can identify which payment method contributes more to their overall revenue and make informed decisions about optimizing payment processing systems or incentivizing certain payment methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Planning:** The difference in fare amounts between credit card and cash payments can also have implications for financial planning. The company can assess transaction costs, reconcile cash handling expenses, and evaluate the impact of payment processing fees on their financial statements.\n",

    "Answer for Q2:\n",
    "Regarding the A/B test project's realism and assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Educational Project:** It's important to note that this was an educational project, and the dataset used may not fully reflect the complexities and real-world dynamics of a taxi company's operations. Real-world A/B tests typically involve more rigorous experimental designs, sample sizes, and considerations for external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assumptions:** The hypothesis test assumes that the sampled data is representative of the entire population, and that the two groups (credit card users and cash users) are independent and randomly selected. These assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, as there may be confounding variables or selection biases that could impact the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limited Factors Considered:** The hypothesis test focused solely on the average total fare amount and the payment type. In practice, there are various other factors that can influence fare amounts, such as distance, time of day, surge pricing, and additional charges. These factors were not considered in this analysis.\n",
